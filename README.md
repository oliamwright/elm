ELM
===

*ELM* is a project management tool designed for fascilitating scrum.  Originally developed for internal use, in an effort to regain control of a development process gone astray, we release it into the wild in the hope that it will be useful.

Disclaimer
----------
*ELM* was developed rapidly to urgently fill a need.  This shows in parts.  It is still in very active development.
